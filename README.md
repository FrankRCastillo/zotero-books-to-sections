# Books to Sections
Zotero plugin for splitting books into book sections.

This is a work in progress.

The primary motivation for developing this plugin was to easily split up edited books with chapters written by multiple authors, making it easier to reference these later on.

## To do:
1. As a user, in the case that a PDF doesn't have an outline or if the outline isn't accurate, I want to write in a text box the titles and pages to create the book sections.
