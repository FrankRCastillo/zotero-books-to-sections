# Books to Sections
Zotero plugin for splitting books into book sections.

This is a work in progress.

The primary motivation for developing this plugin was to easily split up edited books with chapters written by multiple authors, making it easier to reference these later on.

## To do:
1. Allow authors to be included in output-b2bs format.
