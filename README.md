# Books to Sections
Zotero plugin for splitting books into book sections.

This is a work in progress.

The primary motivation for developing this plugin was to easily split up edited books with chapters written by multiple authors, making it easier to reference these later on.

## To do:
1. Allow authors to be included in output-b2bs format.
2. Create UI to show ToC tree and allow users to select.
3. Use page for section and page from the next section minus one to create a page range.
4. Export automatically if depth of ToC is 1.
5. Turn drop down menu item into sub-menu. Include the following features:
  a. Create blank outline file.
  b. Attempt to create an outline.
  b. Separate using PDF outline.
  c. Separate using outline file.
